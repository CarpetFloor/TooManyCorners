-Simple FPS
-Game goes on forever, with any number of players able to join at any time
-Leaderboard that constantly updates based off of which players have defeated the most of other players
-Stuff:
    >Guns
    >Melee weapons
    >Armor
    >Health items
-Fixed loot locations that will regenerate random loot after some time after being looted
-Players drop everything when defeated, and all of it can be taken by other players
-Fast-ish paced:
    >Movement speed is not slow, but not extremely fast either
    >Every player does not have much health, so even the weakest weapons against the strongest body armor
        will take roughly 5-7 shots
    >Multiple types of movements that can be done, from diving to sliding
-With guns, the recoile should be high enough that guns will not feel like a laser, but still be controllable 
    for most people
-Ammo:
    >System will be simple in that there will be the magazine capacity and total ammo
    >Ammo alone can not be found anywhere, and cannot be picked up from other players, so players will have to 
        keep getting new weapons
-Armor:
    >Multiple types that provide different levels of protection
    >The better protection, the slower the player moves
    >Armor acts as a shield, in that it takes damage before the player takes damage
    >When enough damage has been dealt to the armor, it is destroyed
-Health:
    >Regenerates slowly over time
    >Can also be replenished through health items
    >Health items can be spammed
-Durability will not exist for anything
-Inventory system:
    >Simple, so no way to atually open inventory, as everything can be seen on screen at all times
    >Can hold up to 2 weapons at a time
    >Can hold up to 3 health items at a time
    >Can only have 1 armor equiped at a time
-Looting:
    >When looting a loot location or player, a grid will open up that shows everything that can be looted, 
        and when hovering the mouse over an item, something will come up like "press 1 to equip or swap 
        with your first weapon", or "press 2 to equip or swap with the health item in your second slot"
    >When a player is defeated, their body will stay on the ground for some time to be looted, however, 
        after everything they are carrying has been taken, or some time has passed, their body will 
        disappear
    >Loot locations will only regenerate loot after some time once all of the loot has been taken
-Movement:
    >Stamina that lasts a decent amount of time and regenerates quickly
    >Normal movement
    >(uses stamina) Sprinting
    >Crouch
    >Prone
    >Leaning
    >(uses stamina) Can slide in any direction by springting and tapping crouch, will slide to the last 
        direction the player was moving in before tapping the crouch button
    >(uses stamina) Can dive to the ground by sprinting and tapping prone, will dive to the last 
        direction the player was moving in before tapping the prone button
    >Differences between sliding and diving are that sliding keeps the player moving, but also keeps 
        them more exposed
    >(uses stamina) Can dodge to the left or right by FIGURE OUT LATER
-Time period of everything should not be anything specific, meaning that the weapons will span 
    multiple eras
-Map:
    >Medium-sized building with many rooms and hallways
    >Lighting is decent, but the lighting should not be even, and there will be some dark areas
    >No doors
    >No windows
    >Some walls might have chunks missing that will act sort of as windows
-When starting out, each player will only have 1 random gun that is not very good
-Graphics should either be stylized, or decent
